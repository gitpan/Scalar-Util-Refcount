1.0.2:
  - I'd like to thank pax for turning extended attributes into nice
    little extra files to mess up the build process.  That was really
    cool.  Anyway, they're gone now.

1.0.1:
  - Specify minimum required version of Exporter, which turns out to be
    the one shipped with Perl 5.8.3, whereas the module claims to only
    require 5.8.0.
  - Add a META.yml, which seems to be all the rage these days.

1.0:
  - Initial release.
