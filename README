This module provides two functions to show reference counts of Perl objects.

This can be handy when testing/debugging and you want to know what the
heck is going on.

This is a trivial module. The documentation is longer than the code.
Heck, the BSD license at the top of the file is longer than the code.
It took longer to make it release-ready than it took to write it.
It's handy, but seems almost not worth releasing.

I bet many of us have code like that in our personal libraries, and I
can't help thinking that if more of us took the hour to clean it up,
put it in a sensible namespace, write some documentation, and release
it, the world would be a better place.

Install the module in the usual manner:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

The C wrapper generated by SWIG is included here, so SWIG is not necessary
to build and install this module.

If you want to re-generate the SWIG wrapper code, use:

  swig -perl5 -nopm Refcount.i

The "-nopm" is important -- if not included, the .pm file will be clobbered,
and I am not using the SWIG-generated .pm file directly here.

This module is released under a BSD license (3-clause).
